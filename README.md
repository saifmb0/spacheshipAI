# ðŸš€ SpaceshipAI

SpaceshipAI is an integrated platform for simulating, monitoring, and managing spaceship missions using AI, IoT, and web technologies. It combines backend APIs, AI-driven analytics, IoT data streams, and a user-friendly UI for mission control and astronaut management.

## Features
- **AI Module:** Analyze mission data, generate reports, and simulate sensor data.
- **Backend API:** Django-based RESTful API for managing spaceships, missions, and astronauts.
- **IoT Integration:** Kafka-based consumer for real-time sensor data ingestion.
- **UI:** Interactive web interface for login, mission management, and astronaut/ship dashboards.
